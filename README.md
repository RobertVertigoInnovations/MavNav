# This concept we we're diagnosed a problem in which students get lost on campus
# then finding a way to create an application that will guide them around the campus
# with landmark and notes that will inform the user.
# We would of liked to implement a way for their friends to show up on their maps and for them
# to communicate and meet up with them.
